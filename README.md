## Build Cardano Settlement Layer Base Image
This is designed as a base image which can be used to run any of the cardano-sl binaries.

This is an alternative to having to [do it yourself](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/master/docs/how-to/build-cardano-sl-and-daedalus-from-source-code.md). We've worked hard to make this as simple as possible, so that it is the most stable and easily deployable cardano docker image out there.

Please contribute! Anyone that adds a line of code gets a 🍺. Anyone that can remove a line of code gets 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺!

We want this image to be as simple as possible, so removing complexity is important to us. So is version pinning everything.
